# Topics
Topics are Feature, Actions or Key Themes.
The documentation stored under "Topics" are designed to be a reference point (similar to the official documentation, however more user guided).
A Topic may be references by other Topics or be referenced by Pages.

## Topics Structure
### File Naming Convention
* Topics must be placed in their respective product folders. Topics that are shared by multiple platforms/products are to be placed in "Common".
* The Topic file must be .md (Markdown).
* The name should be as representitive of the related URL as possible while remaining human readable in Pascal case.

### Topics Content
A Topic should cover the following headings:
* **Overview**: A 2-3 sentence summary of the Topic/Feature/Action/etc, designed to explain the key concept to a user. 
* **Guides**: Links to community generated content that cover this topic. Note: For a guide to be eligible for this section, the content of the guide must primarily focus on the topic.
* **Documentaiton & References**: Links to the Official Salesforce Documentation & References
* **Trailhead**: Links to relevant Trailhead content

As a best practice, key topics (actions/features) should link to other relevant Topics pages, and to Pages where those Topics are used.
