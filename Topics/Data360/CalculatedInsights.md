## Calculated Insights Overview 
 Calculated Insights in Salesforce Data Cloud allows you to define and compute key metrics and attributes from your consolidated customer data. By leveraging various functions and operators, you can aggregate, count, and perform calculations on your unified profiles and interaction data to derive meaningful insights. These powerful insights, such as 'total purchase value' or 'last product viewed,' can then be used to create advanced customer segments, personalize experiences across channels, and drive more targeted activation strategies.
