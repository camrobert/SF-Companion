## Data Action Targets Overview 
 Data Action Targets in Salesforce Data Cloud are specific destinations where you can send unified customer data or insights to trigger actions in other systems. These targets act as connectors, allowing Data Cloud to communicate seamlessly with various platforms like Salesforce CRM, Marketing Cloud Engagement, or even custom external applications via webhooks. By configuring a target, you enable automated, real-time responses and personalized customer experiences across your entire ecosystem, based on the rich, consolidated customer profiles in Data Cloud.
