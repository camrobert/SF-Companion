## Communication Capping Overview 
 Communication Capping in Salesforce Data Cloud is a powerful feature designed to prevent customers from being overwhelmed with too many messages across various marketing channels. It allows businesses to set intelligent limits on the frequency of communications, such as emails or SMS, that a customer receives within a defined timeframe. This ensures a more positive and engaging customer experience by avoiding message fatigue, which can otherwise lead to unsubscribes or reduced engagement.
