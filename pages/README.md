# Pages
Pages are linked to the URL currently viewed by the user, and are defined in rules.json.
The documentation stored under "Pages" are designed to be a reference point to the actions and purpose of the page.
A Page may contain Topics (features, actions, processes, etc) , which are stored under the "Topics" folder.

## Pages Structure
### File Naming Convention
* Pages must be placed in their respective product folders. 
* The page file must be .html,
* The name should be as representitive of the related URL as possible while remaining human readable in Pascal case.

### Page Content
A Page should cover the following headings:
* **Overview**: A 1-3 sentence summary of the page. 
* **Key Functions**: A bullet-point list of the primary actions a user will conduct on the page

As a best practice, key topics (actions/features) should like to relevant Topics pages.
